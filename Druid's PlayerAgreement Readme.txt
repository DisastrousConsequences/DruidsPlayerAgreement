Announcing DruidsPlayerAgreement 1.10!

DruidsPlayerAgreement is a server actor that displays a terms of usage 
agreement to your players. 

As each player joins your server, a check is performed to see if they
have previously agreed to your terms. If they have not, a message is 
displayed about your terms, and they must wait for an interval before they
can accept them.

To use this server actor:

You must add a line with the other ServerActors to your UT2004.ini:
ServerActor=DruidsPlayerAgreement110.PlayerAgreementServerActor

And you must add a line with the other ServerPackages to your UT2004.ini:
ServerPackage=DruidsPlayerAgreement110

The PlayerAgreement.ini has all the configuration options documented in it.
Make sure and edit this file before you activate this server actor. ;)
